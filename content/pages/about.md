## Projects

### [Breast Cancer Detection Using Thermal Imaging](https://github.com/gpintoruiz/Thermal-Imaging-Breast-Cancer-Detection)
![Breast Cancer Detection](https://github.com/gpintoruiz/Thermal-Imaging-Breast-Cancer-Detection/raw/main/assets/research_methodology.png)
This project uses thermal imaging to non-invasively detect breast cancer. By analyzing infrared radiation, it identifies anomalies associated with cancer. The approach involves data collection, preprocessing, CNN-based classification, and model evaluation, providing a comprehensive methodology for early detection.

### [Multimodal Early Detection of Parkinson's Disease](https://github.com/AndresFelipeMunozAguilar/Proyecto_Final_IA1_UIS)
![Parkinson's Detection](https://github.com/AndresFelipeMunozAguilar/Proyecto_Final_IA1_UIS/blob/main/notebooks/figures/High%20Quality%20Banner%20Multimodal%20Early%20Detection%20of%20Parkinson's%20Disease.png?raw=true)
This project develops a non-invasive multimodal approach for early Parkinson‚Äôs disease detection using video and audio analysis. By identifying patterns in motor symptoms like facial rigidity and speech disorders, it employs machine learning and neural networks to enhance diagnosis.

### [Finanzify](https://github.com/gpintoruiz/finanzify)
![finanzify](https://github.com/gpintoruiz/finanzify/blob/main/finanzify.gif?raw=true)
Finanzify is a financial management tool with features for tracking income, expenses, and investments. Built with Angular and Bootstrap for the frontend, and Spring Boot with Java and MySQL for the backend. It includes dynamic charts using Chart.js and secure data handling with hash encoders.

### [Moview](https://github.com/gpintoruiz/moview)
![moview](https://github.com/gpintoruiz/moview/blob/main/moview.gif?raw=true)
Moview is a dynamic movie review platform featuring interactive carousels, detailed movie pages, and powerful search. Built with React.js, it provides movie ratings, trailers, and reviews from [The Movie Database API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). The backend uses Node.js, MongoDB, and JWT for secure, efficient data management.
